Changes/enhancements made to website:
I chose to remove the theme picker feature for now because it wasn't quite robust as I wanted it to be and I wanted to avoid having too many links in my navigation bar to keep it more user-friendly. I may go back and refine this feature in the future. I also decided to replace the CSS slide-in transition for the introduction details with a fade-in animation because it felt more appropriate and user-friendly. I made sure to update all buttons and social links to have smooth transitions on hover, and also refined the hambuger menu on mobile by adding a flex-wrap layout with a fade-in transition. For accessibility improvements, I added aria-current attributes to indicate the current page in the navigation bar and enhanced hover effects for better user experience. Lastly, I addressed HTML validation issues by fixing trailing slashes and ensuring `<style>` tags were properly placed within `<noscript>` elements in the `<head>` section.
