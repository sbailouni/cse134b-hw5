Changes/enhancements made to website:
I chose to remove the theme picker feature for now because it wasn't quite robust as I wanted it to be and I wanted to avoid having too many links in my navigation bar to keep it more user-friendly. I may go back and refine this feature in the future. I also decided to replace the CSS slide-in transition for the introduction details with a fade-in animation because it felt more appropriate and user-friendly.
